# __Breast Cancer Prediction__

This is my personal project in which I explore if a given cancer cell is benign or malignant to be able to treat the cancer cells in a timely manner, build and train models.

DATA was obtained from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository: 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29

Dataset Information:

1.	Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
2.	radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
3.	texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
4.	perimeter
5.	area
6.	smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
7.	compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
8.	concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
9.	concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
10.	symmetry
11.	fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)


The Jupyter notebook file includes 3 parts;

a-) Exploratory Data Analysis

b-) Reducing Features and Inferential Statistics

c-) Machine Learning
